## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#packages required to run all for the code in this file
install.packages('sqldf')
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('dplyr')
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

This file only contains the R code used to analyze the data, the sql querries involved in my decision making process are not shown, although the steps taken will be explained.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
Bank <- read.csv(file = 'Bank.csv', header = TRUE)
```

The zipcodes are the same for all of the data so this will prove to be unimportant in analysis, they can be omitted.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
Bank <- select(Bank, -c(zipcodeOri,zipMerchant))
```

Omit all instances where the gender was unknown. Done in gender because since it contains the customer gender info and whether they are a person or enterprise. Unknowns represented a small minority of the cases. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
Bank <- Bank[!(Bank$gender == "'U'"),]
```

Rename factos in age to their ranges for easier understanding 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'0'"] <- "-18"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'1'"] <- "19-25"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'2'"] <- "26-35"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'3'"] <- "36-45"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'4'"] <- "46-55"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'5'"] <- "56-65"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'6'"] <- "65+"
levels(Bank$age)[levels(Bank$age) == "'U'"] <- "E"
```

The following is the code used to produce different plots ofr visualizing the data and gain more understanding:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# barplot agegroups fraudulent and 
A <- with(Bank, table(fraud, age))
barplot(A, beside = TRUE, legend = TRUE, xlab = 'Age Groups', ylab = 'Count')
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# barplot agegroups fraudulent and 
B <- with(Bank, table(fraud, gender))
barplot(B, beside = TRUE, legend = TRUE, xlab = 'Gender', ylab = 'Count')
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#amount for frauds and ordinary
safes <- sqldf('select amount from Bank where fraud = 0')
fraud <- sqldf('select amount from Bank where fraud = 1')

sdfraud <- sd(fraud$amount)
sdsafes <- sd(safes$amount)

P <- ggplot(fraud, aes(x=amount))+geom_density(color = 'darkblue', fill = 'lightblue')
Q <- ggplot(safes, aes(x=amount))+geom_density(color = 'black', fill = 'pink', xlim = 1000)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#break full data set into age groups
A <- split(Bank, Bank$age)
A0 <- A[[1]]
A1 <- A[[2]]
A2 <- A[[3]]
A3 <- A[[4]]
A4 <- A[[5]]

#find % fraud by age group

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#customers and merchants
CM <-(sqldf('select customer, merchant, category from Bank where fraud = 1'))
fmerchants <- count(CM, merchant)
fcustomers <- count(CM, customer)
mer <- fmerchants[order(-fmerchants$n),]
cus <- fcustomers[order(-fcustomers$n),]
merch <- sqldf('select fmerchants.merchant, fmerchants.n, CM.category from fmerchants left join CM on fmerchants.merchant = CM.merchant')
custo <- sqldf('select fcustomers.customer, fcustomers.n from fcustomers order by n desc')
MM <- sqldf('select distinct * from merch order by n desc')
CC <- sqldf('select distinct * from custo order by n desc')
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#fraud by category
Cat <- sqldf('select category from Bank where fraud = 1')
CatCount <- count(Cat, Cat$category)
HighF <- sqldf('select distinct merchant, category from Bank')
puma <- count(HighF, HighF $category)
```

Creating balanced datasets that are over and undersampled.

required libraies

```{r setup, include= FALSE}
install.packages("unbalanced")
library(unbalanced)
```

creating the balanced data sets through the functions below

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
BankClean <- select(Bank, -c(customer,merchant))
Under <- ubUnder(BankClean, Bank$fraud)
BankUnder <- data.frame(Under$X)
Over  <-  ubOver(BankClean, Bank$fraud)
BankOver <- data.frame(Over$X)
```

Writing to a new csv files to be used for ML algorithms

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
write.csv(Bank, file = "BankClean.csv")
write.csv(BankOver, file = "BankOver.csv")
write.csv(BankUnder, file = "BankUnder.csv")
```
